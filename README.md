# Summary 
Hello, my name is Alexander Almeida, but I go by Alex. I am a junior at the Brockton High School.

This year I am trying to better myself in both fitness level, academic level and just trying to make myself more well rounded for the future. After school I drive around for Driver's ed. I enjoy playing the sport volleyball and I am going to be trying out for the JV team this year. I really enjoy Marvel movies and other projects done by Disney.
